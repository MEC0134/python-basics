# This is a python comment

# Below is how to declare variables in python, notice the absence of semicolons and explicit type declaring
# x = 5
# y = "Hello World!"

# How to concatenate str with a non-string type in python using built in str() method, aka casting
# print(y + " I am " + str(x) + " years old.")

"""
Normally we do not explicitly specify data type in python,
we can however apply casting to a variable using built in methods as
demonstrated below
"""

x = int(3)
y = "John"
z = float(3)

# print(x, y, z)


# Getting the data type of variables
print(type(y))
print(type(x))
print(type(z))
